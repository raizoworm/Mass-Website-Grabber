Dozens of Cyber security platforms had published at the end of last year about dozens of vulnerabilities in WordPress, and they had also published earlier this year about the presence of millions of backdoors in many scripts.

This is what prompted us to program {Fox Ex v2} tool, which specializes in hacking test based on the most important vulnerabilities and backdoors that were discovered at the end of last year and this year.
